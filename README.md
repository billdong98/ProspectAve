<P> Have you and your friends ever wanted to enjoy a night out at the Street, but weren't sure which clubs were open? We've all been in your shoes--that's why we created ProspectAve. ProspectAve is a web application that allows Princeton students to see which eating clubs are open on a given night, as well as on dates in the future. We work closely with all of Princeton’s eating clubs to provide accurate information, and ProspectAve is the only resource where students can view all 11 clubs’ events in one place.

<P> Our webapp is located at <a href="https://prospectave.io/" target="_blank">prospectave.io</a>. We have assigned all of you as officers of a different club; in order to log in as an officer, click the Officer Login button on the home page or go <a href="https://prospectave.io:1738/login">here</a> (note that the officer page is not accessible on mobile). 

<P> Our GitHub is located <a href="https://github.com/billdong98/ProspectAve" target="_blank">here</a>. It is a private GitHub repository, but you should all have access.

<P> In case something goes wrong, contact Michael Man (<a href="mailto:mman@princeton.edu" target="_blank">mman@princeton.edu </a>).
